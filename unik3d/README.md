## Installation

Requirements are not in principle hard requirements, but there might be some differences (not tested):
- Linux
- Python 3.10+ 
- CUDA 11.8+

Install the environment needed to run UniK3D with:
```shell
export VENV_DIR=<YOUR-VENVS-DIR>
export NAME=unik3d

python -m venv $VENV_DIR/$NAME
source $VENV_DIR/$NAME/bin/activate

# Install UniK3D and dependencies (more recent CUDAs work fine)
pip install -e . --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Install Pillow-SIMD (Optional)
pip uninstall pillow
CC="cc -mavx2" pip install -U --force-reinstall pillow-simd

# Install KNN (for evaluation only)
cd ./unik3d/ops/knn;bash compile.sh;cd ../../../
```

If you use conda, you should change the following: 
```shell
python -m venv $VENV_DIR/$NAME -> conda create -n $NAME python=3.11
source $VENV_DIR/$NAME/bin/activate -> conda activate $NAME
```

Run UniK3D on the given assets to test your installation (you can check this script as guideline for further usage):
```shell
python ./scripts/demo.py
```
If everything runs correctly, `demo.py` should print: `RMSE on 3D clouds for ScanNet sample: 21.9cm`.
`demo.py` allows you also to save output information, e.g. rays, depth and 3D pointcloud as `.ply` file.


## Gradio Demo

- Plase visit our [HugginFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lpiccinelli/UniK3D-demo) for an installation-free test on your images!
- You can use a local Gradio demo if the HuggingFace is too slow (CPU-based) by running `python ./gradio_demo.py` after installation.


## Get Started

After installing the dependencies, you can load the pre-trained models easily from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lpiccinelli) as follows:

```python
from unik3d.models import UniK3D

model = UniK3D.from_pretrained("lpiccinelli/unik3d-vitl") # vitl for ViT-L backbone
```

Then you can generate the metric 3D estimation and rays prediction directly from a single RGB image only as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Move to CUDA, if any
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)

# Load the RGB image and the normalization will be taken care of by the model
image_path = "./assets/demo/scannet.jpg"
rgb = torch.from_numpy(np.array(Image.open(image_path))).permute(2, 0, 1) # C, H, W

predictions = model.infer(rgb)

# Point Cloud in Camera Coordinate
xyz = predictions["points"]

# Unprojected rays
rays = predictions["rays"]

# Metric Depth Estimation
depth = predictions["depth"]
```

You can use ground truth camera parameters or rays as input to the model as well:
```python
from unik3d.utils.camera import (Pinhole, OPENCV, Fisheye624, MEI, Spherical)

camera_path = "assets/demo/scannet.json" # any other json file
with open(camera_path, "r") as f:
    camera_dict = json.load(f)

params = torch.tensor(camera_dict["params"])
name = camera_dict["name"]
camera = eval(name)(params=params)
predictions = model.infer(rgb, camera)
```

To use the forward method for your custom training, you should:  
1) Take care of the dataloading:  
  a) ImageNet-normalization  
  b) Long-edge based resizing (and padding) with input shape provided in `image_shape` under configs  
  c) `BxCxHxW` format  
  d) If any intriniscs given, adapt them accordingly to your resizing  
2) Format the input data structure as:  
```python
data = {"image": rgb, "rays": rays}
predictions = model(data, {})
```

## Infer

To run locally, you can use the script `./scripts/infer.py` via the following command:

```bash
# Save the output maps and ply
python ./scripts/infer.py --input IMAGE_PATH --output OUTPUT_FOLDER --config-file configs/eval/vitl.json --camera-path CAMERA_JSON --save --save-ply
```

```
Usage: scripts/infer.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --input PATH                Path to input image.
  --output PATH               Path to output directory.
  --config-file PATH          Path to config file. Please check ./configs/eval.
  --camera-path PATH          (Optional) Path to camera parameters json file. See assets/demo
                              for a few examples. The file needs a 'name' field with
                              the camera model from unik3d/utils/camera.py and a
                              'params' field with the camera parameters as in the
                              corresponding class docstring.
  --resolution-level INTEGER  Resolution level in [0,10). Higher values means it will
                              resize to larger resolution which increases details but
                              decreases speed. Lower values lead to opposite.
  --save                      Save outputs as (colorized) png.
  --save-ply                  Save pointcloud as ply.
```

## Model Zoo

The available models are the following:

<table border="0">

</table>

Please visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lpiccinelli) or click on the links above to access the repo models with weights.
You can load UniK3D as the following, with `name` variable matching the table above:

```python
from unik3d.models import UniK3D

model_v1 = UniK3D.from_pretrained(f"lpiccinelli/{name}")
```

In addition, we provide loading from TorchHub as:

```python
backbone = "vitl"

model = torch.hub.load("lpiccinelli-eth/UniK3D", "UniK3D", backbone=backbone, pretrained=True, trust_repo=True, force_reload=True)
```

You can look into function `UniK3D` in [hubconf.py](hubconf.py) to see how to instantiate the model from local file: provide a local `path` in line 23.
